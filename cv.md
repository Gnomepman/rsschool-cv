# Info
I am 18 years old, highly motivated student, who is studing Computer Science in Chernihiv State Technological University, currenty finishing second year. Programming always has been my passion. I made my choise to become programmer in the beginning of high school. Since then I started analysing what programming languages exist, whats the difference between them, what to choose to study. Long story short, on the second year of university I finally realise that I want to study JavaScript. And here I am, studing Front-End in rs-school and willing to become proud member of rs-community.
